Hello Everyone
I'm an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at SVNIT Surat, with a solid foundation in embedded systems, instrumentation, and data analytics. My work spans circuit design, microcontroller integration, and performance visualisation—shaped by hands-on projects and national competitions like DD Robocon.

I focus on building solutions that are technically robust, scalable, and well-documented. This GitHub portfolio reflects my journey through real-world engineering challenges—from solar data dashboards to robotics and decision-making circuits.
