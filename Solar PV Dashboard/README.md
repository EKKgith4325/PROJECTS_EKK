# Photovoltaic Performance Dashboard

This repository presents a seasonal analysis of solar photovoltaic (PV) performance using visualisations and metrics such as Capacity Utilisation Factor (CUF%), Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), and energy output. The dashboard helps identify how environmental conditions affect solar energy yield across different seasons.

## Dashboard Features

- **Line Chart**: Tracks monthly CUF% from January to November 2023, showing seasonal trends.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares average energy output (kWh) across summer, monsoon, and winter.
- **Scatter Plot**: Displays the relationship between GHI and CUF%, with seasonal clustering.
- **Textual Analysis**: Summarises key insights and correlations.

## Key Insights

- CUF% peaks during summer months due to higher irradiance.
- Monsoon and winter seasons show reduced solar performance.
- Strong linear correlation between GHI and CUF%, confirming irradiance as a key driver of PV efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- Power BI  (for dashboard rendering)
- Excel
